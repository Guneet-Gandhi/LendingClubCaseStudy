# Lending Club Case Study
>  Brief description of the project.


Business Understanding : Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace,facilitating personal loans,
business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
 Two types of risks are associated with the bankâ€™s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

 The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

In this case study, we used EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.


 If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate) 
Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'. 
Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan Loan rejected:The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)


 The company wants to understand which factors are leading to high default and how the quality of the loans distributed can be improved.

 Process: 

 Step 1: Data Cleaning 1
Step 2: Univariate Analysis
Step 3: Bivaraiate/Multivariate Analysis
Step 4: Results
